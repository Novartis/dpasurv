## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* added a value to the plot function as requested as well as reviewed and made polishing edits to all value fields across all package functions.

* Made sure to restore user's graphical parameters after changing them in examples and in vignettes as requested.

## R CMD check results
